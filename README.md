# Automated Nuclei Detection for Biomedical Research  

## Overview  

This project implements an **AI-based semantic segmentation model** to **automatically detect cell nuclei** in biomedical images. The ability to accurately identify nuclei is critical for **accelerating research** on various diseases, including **cancer, heart disease, and rare disorders**. By automating this process with a deep learning model, we aim to:  

- **Speed up drug discovery** by analyzing how cells respond to treatments.  
- **Enhance biological research** by enabling efficient examination of DNA within nuclei.  
- **Improve overall research efficiency** in medical and pharmaceutical studies.  

Our model is based on **U-Net**, a widely used convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image segmentation. The project follows a complete **machine learning pipeline**, including **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment**.

## Dataset  

- **Source**: [2018 Data Science Bowl - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-bowl-2018/overview)  
- **Dataset File**: `data-science-bowl-2018.zip` (not included in this repository, download from Kaggle)  

The dataset contains labeled images of **cell nuclei** in various biological samples. It is used for training, validating, and testing our AI model.

## Project Workflow  

1. **Problem Formulation**: Define the importance of nuclei detection and its real-world applications.  
2. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Load and preprocess images.  
   - Apply augmentation techniques to increase dataset variability.  
3. **Model Development**:  
   - Implement a **U-Net architecture** for nuclei segmentation.  
   - Use **transfer learning** for the downsampling path.  
   - Train with **early stopping** to prevent overfitting.  
   - Achieve **94%+ accuracy on both training and validation data**.  
4. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Use performance metrics like **Accuracy and Loss**.  
   - Visualize segmentation results.  
5. **Model Deployment**:  
   - Save the trained model in `.keras` format.  
   - Use the model to **predict on test images**.  
   - Export and visualize predictions.

## Model Architecture  

The **U-Net model** consists of:  
- **Encoder (Downsampling Path)**: Uses a **pre-trained model** for feature extraction (transfer learning).  
- **Decoder (Upsampling Path)**: Custom layers to reconstruct segmentation masks.  

### Model Summary
